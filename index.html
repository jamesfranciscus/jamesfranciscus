          <p id="sig88">
            I started at the Octorara School District as an armed
            security officer. I made patrols by foot and automobile of all
            schools. I acted as a deterrent to crime and enforced
            school district rules and policies. July 2016 I was promoted
            to an operations manager. I am responsible for the overall
            operations of the Brandywine Hospital, Phoenixville
            Hospital and Jenner’s Ponds accounts. This includes
            quality control, hiring, firing, and training security officers.

        EDUCATION
      </h3>
        <p id="edu">
          I am a graduate of the Coatesville Area School District. I
          also graduated from the Pennsylvania State Police
          Academy and the F.B.I. National Academy. I have also

      <h3>
        COMMUNICATION
      </h3>
        <p id="comm">
          During my career, I, have had to communicate both
          verbally and in writing to elected officials, neighborhood
          association groups, District Attorney’s Office, news media,
          subordinates, citizens in the community, along with people
          under stressful situations.
          <br>
          I feel that I have kept my superiors well informed and have
          been an effective communicator with others I have
          encountered.
        </p>

      <h3>
        LEADERSHIP
      </h3>
        <p id="lead">
          I have held many leadership positions during my career
          and I feel that I have been an effective leader. I have been a Chief of 
          Police in two Chester County communities,
          President of the Chester County Police Chief’s
          Association. I have always lead by setting a good example,
          setting the bar high for subordinates, helping to develop
          employees to do a better job and learn all they could about
          their chosen career. I have always tried to be a coach and
          cheerleader to the people I served with.
